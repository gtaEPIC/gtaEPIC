You wanted to know more about me? Well, I'm flattered! 😊
Well there isn't a whole lot more to say, but you may have noticed I didn't mention my pronouns.
That's because I am Transgender, just not out publicly yet. 
So, I'm still using he/him pronouns, but I am also comfortable with they/them pronouns.
My planned name is `Jasmine` however, I'll still be `gtaEPIC` online.
